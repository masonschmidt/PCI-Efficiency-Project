  "description": "Widely Used Webserver Framework  \r Easy to Read Program Code  \r Allows for Easy Callbacks  \r Easily Deals with Paths  \r ## Connect-Timeout  \r Allows for Request to Timeout and Server Handles The Connection Pop\r ## Seed Random\r Math.Random does not have a set Random Seed, so to alleviate this issue, Seed Random is imported into the program.\r ## Events  \r Allows for Emitters on each random number in the rng array. Listeners can be connected to the Emitters.\r # Program Constraints\r ## Input Time  \r Time until the new Fuel Consumed Value is produced.\r ## Output Time  \r Time until the new Power Produced Value is Produced.\r ## Server Size\r Size of the Server in terms of array memory\r ## Status Time\r Time before the server program shows its connection status\r ## RNG Array\r An array of random numbers that allows for synchronous results.\r ## Input Emitters\r An array of Emitters that are in parallel with the rng array.\r ## Output Emitters\r An array of Emitters that are in parallel with the rng array.\r ## Connections\r An array of low memory values that show true or false for a connection to show server details.\r # Server Dependencies and Memory  \r ## Scaling Server Memory Globally\r The RNG array is connected to the emitters in such a way that we can imagine the input emitters are connected to the first N RNG elements and the output emitters are connected to the last N rng elements. The connection array shall span the whole of the RNG array.\r # Server Status Log  \r A Log to the console which can be wrote and appended to a log file at a certain amount of time\r # Helper Functions  \r ## Set Outbound Emitter\r ### Parameter: Generator Number",
